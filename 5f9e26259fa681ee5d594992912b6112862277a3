      "message": "Note that, unit tests are failing in dlrn build job because it\u0027s actually not building 6.0.0 but latest commit in master (6.0.1.dev5) which includes https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/python-openstackclient/+/749038 which is not tagged yet.\n\nSo, fortunatelly we actually can live pinned (so far, we should move to current u-c before Zed GA). As workaround i\u0027d make unit tests conditional to only run when version is \u003c\u003d 6.0.0 or something like that.",

      "message": "Yes, it\u0027s ok for Zed (pinned to 6.0.0). The master job is failing as openstackclient is using, since post-6.0.0, an openstacksdk feature [1] available since 0.100.0 as you mentioned. But we are locked to openstacksdk 0.61.0 since [2].\nI\u0027ll add a conditionnal to ignore test when version \u003e 6.0.0, in order to pass CI here and unblock Zed release preparation. But we\u0027ll be blocked in master at next openstackclient bump release.\n\n[1] https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/python-openstackclient/+/749038\n[2] https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdoinfo/+/43207",
