See python3-openstackclient is introduced as BR in:\n\nhttps://logserver.rdoproject.org/49/49349/6/check/DLRN-rpmbuild-centos9-compare-builddeps/df5034c/job-output.txt\n\nMy guess is that, it\u0027s pulled as dependency for some of the new doc build requirements included in https://github.com/openstack/python-openstackclient/blob/7ea78b6ef65481c8e97bac959b4f11e3ecae8a3e/doc/requirements.txt\n\nIf that\u0027s the case, it would be enough to disable doc building for bootstraping a new repo. Could you test it with a DNM patch on top of this setting with_doc to 0 and see the result of the DLRN-rpmbuild-centos9-compare-builddeps job?\n\n\nWRT losing neutronclient as runtime dep, LGTM",
